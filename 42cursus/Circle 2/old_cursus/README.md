### Thoughts about this project
#

It's a very cool project I've wanted to do since I first heard about it. Creating your own game is always fun. I didn't really enjoy the MinilibX because there is no documentation, and it's a bit hard to handle. But the hardest part was using structures. I had never done that before, but I learned, and now I love structs. This is the way.
