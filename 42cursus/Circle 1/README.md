### Thoughts about this project
#

Finally, I can use printf(), but first I need to code it! Overall, an easy project that I've done in like 3 days. It was nice to create a entire function, with a lot of files and not one unique piece of code. It's so satisfying to use my own printf and see it work. The bonuses are awful so I skipped it. Maybe one day I will do them?

It was hard to figured out the algorithm first, but once I understood the project it was easy. Well, except for all the leaks and segfault that occured. This thing was tedious for that. I didn't do bonuses but I heard they are simple. But I need to advance (points are missing).

The introduction to the world of Virtual Machine. I already used VM but not for system administration side. It's easy with a guide (alone... well, good luck) but we need to understand what we do. I know a bit of that so no problem on that side. I'm not a fan of system administration so I don't know if I will love doing more of this, but perhaps? Trying to make a true server is maybe fun.
