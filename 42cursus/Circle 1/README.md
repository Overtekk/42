### Thoughts about this project
#

Finally, I can use printf(), but first I need to code it! Overall, an easy project that I've done in like 3 days. It was nice to create a entire function, with a lot of files and not one unique piece of code. It's so satisfying to use my own printf and see it work. The bonuses are awful so I skipped it. Maybe one day I will do them?
