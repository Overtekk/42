### Thoughts about this project
#

It was interesting to create many functions, which will be usefull in the future. Some were easy, others were a bit harder ~*(hello mem functions)*~. It was also interesting to learn linked lists, even if at the beginning this thing was awful.
It was also the time to create my first Makefile (well, I dit it in the Piscine-Reloaded project but anyway...). And yes, I know, my main is a very monstrous thing but, hey, it's cool (but you can break it so easily...).
